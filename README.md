# SuiteCRM Entry Points Template

In this example you can see a ready to use template to create Entry Points.

We have included three examples:

* An Entry Point that creates and Opportunity using a similar WebToLead url. Also we create or update an Account and a Contact depending if these records already exists.
* An Entry Point that creates Seminarie using a similar WebToLead url. Also we create or update a Contact depending if these records already exists.
* An Entry Point that draws a Google Chart (Donut) showing all Opportunities related to a specific account.

## Installation

Just zip the php files and install as any other module in your SuiteCRM instance.
